    <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action packed role playing game that involves much more skill then just pressing buttons. It invloves problem solving and analytical skills as well as mashing buttons when trying to defeat a dragon. The game has won mutliple awards IGN and GameSpot named Skyrim "PC Game of the Year". It also received GameSpot's "Readers' Choice" award. The graphics are incredible, if you are in the middle of playing the game just stop for a second and take a look around and you will see just how unbelievably beautiful the scenery is and how much effort when into the small details.</p>

    <h2>Reasons why Skyrim is awesome:</h2>
    
<ul>
    <li>Incredible graphics</li>
    <li>Never ending mission and different ways to play the game</li> 
    <li>It's almost impossible to be bored while playing</li>
</ul>
    
       <h2>Reasons why Skyrim may not be awesome:</h2>
    
<ul>
    <li>Loading time due to incredibly large map</li>
    <li>Not being able to carry as many items as you may like</li> 
    <li>Glitching</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>In my opinion the loading time and the occasional glitch does not compare to the amount of quests, the unlimited paths you can take, the wonderful graphics and just the sheer fun that you have while playing this video game.</p>
